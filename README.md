## Case Study Questions
### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
### 9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

### 12. Rank All The Things
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, 
but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases 
so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
